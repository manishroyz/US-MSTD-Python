# USMSTD-Python
Python Project Implementation for US-MSTD.
The premise of the implementation is the ability to model changes in Speed of Sound (SOS) to compute the change in temperature. This eliminates the need of a sensor to measure the temperature profile, specially in environments where sensors can't either be deployed or get spoilt owing to the extreme conditions.
